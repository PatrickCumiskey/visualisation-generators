    "# Using the Chronotopic Cartographies Toolset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chronotopic Cartographies spatial schema identifies three principal units of the literary text: *topoi*, or spatial frames; *toporefs*, or linguistic spatial references within a spatial frame; and *connections*, which are described or implied spatial connections between topoi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part one of this notebook gives comprehensive instructions, with worked examples and excercises, on how to use these components to mark up a text using the schema. By the end of it, you will have marked up a text extract using the schema and produced a visualisation of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this notebook explains the process of creating visualisations from an XML file; ie. once you've marked up a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequistes\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst this notebook talks you through the full process for marking up a text, some experience of using XML is recommended. A good primer can be found here: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-newxml/index.html. Wikipedia's [entry on markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) is also useful for an overview of what a markup language is and why they're useful for humanities scholarship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst we won't be diving deep into Python, we will be using some simple commands to check our work and to create visualisations as we go along. If you don't have any familiarity with programming with Python, the sections on *functions*, *variables* and *types* on [this web page](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter1/) are worth reading, but it's not essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never used a Python Notebook before, a tutorial can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Overview-of-the-Notebook-UI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, some familiarity with Mikhail Bakhtin's essay 'Forms of Time and the Chronotope in the Novel' in [_The Dialogic Imagination_](https://utpress.utexas.edu/books/bakdia) and with [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) would be useful.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Topoi\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markup\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<topos type=\"xx\" framename=\"yy\"> </topos>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A topos defines a spatial frame in both terms of narrative and chronotope: i.e., it indicates a place in which a section of narrative is set, and characterises that setting in terms of Bakhtin's terminology. In order to keep track of settings, they are given a unique name (the 'framename' attribute), ideally derived from the text. However, as long as the name is consistent across settings (ie., a setting within the text is always referred to in the ‘frame’ attribute with by same name) it is in effect arbitrary. If a chapter break occurs with the successor set in the same frame, a new identically-named frame will need to be opened, but no connection tag is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Coleridge's *Rime of the Ancyent Marinere*, the text moves between multiple identifiable settings: the Wedding at which the Mariner encounters the Guest; the Harbour from which the Mariner's ship departs; the Southern Ocean where the Mariner shoots the Albatross. Identifying these spaces and naming them allows us to track what proportion of the text is dedicated to each and how they are connected with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each topos is given a 'type' attribute, derived from Bakhtin's chronotope essay. Use the table of chronotopes below and choose which you think is most appropriate. (Note that there is a  degree of subjectivity in both identifying the bounds of the topoi and their chronotopes.) In the example below, the Wedding has been coded ‘encounter’, as this best describes the nature of how the Guest meets the Mariner, whilst the Harbour has been identified as a ‘threshold’ as it marks the point at which the Mariner leaves the safety of his home port and begins his journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**```framename:```** The name of the topos. This is arbitrary and at the coder's discretion, with two caveats: each topos in the text must have a unique framename; and if the text returns to a topos more than once, the corresponding text blocks must have the same framename attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```type:```** The chronotopic archetype, as defined in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chronotope       | Definition \n",
    "---|---\n",
    "encounter | Can occur anywhere (but often on the road), unexpected diversion, sudden shift, any meeting\n",
    "road | Paths, travel, journey, options, coming and going, wandering\n",
    "castle | Confined, Imprisonment, static, discomfort, dark, visible traces of the past\n",
    "idyll | Familiarity, comfort, happiness, pleasure, peace, respite, self-contained, unified, stable, homely, known\n",
    "wilderness | the wild, openness, freedom, untouched, the earth, the natural world, unity\n",
    "anti-idyll | vast, abstract, egotistically sealed-off interior worlds, mechanical, the idyll destroyed, invaded/made alien\n",
    "threshold | The hall, the corridor, the staircase, the street, docks, stations, liminal, emotionally charged, intense, sublime, excess, contrasts \n",
    "parlour | Interior, room, defined, hosting guests, where the public and private merge, where dialogues happen, site of political and commercial intrigue\n",
    "provincial town | Community, locality, rustic, petty-bourgeois, specific locales, quaint little houses and rooms of the town, sleepy streets\n",
    "public square | Dynamic, crowd, forum, metropolitan, the internal externalized (the private/intimate becomes public), theatrical (place of the clown, the rogue, the fool)\n",
    "distortion | Elsewhere, miraculous, bewitched, dreamstates, (occurring on the vertical axis - ie. depth and height)\n",
    "metanarrative | For sections of text removed from the narrative and without a definable sense of space, could be internal (e.g. commentary, where the author inserts themselves, morals, etc) or external (e.g. glosses, framing statements, authorial/editorial notes, etc) to the narrative.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Toporefs indicate the named or otherwise defined places that form a ‘frame’ in the text and their role within it: ie., whether they refer to places within a given topos; another topos outside of the current one; or are being used figuratively. They also indicate how names are connected to topoi frame.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**```role:```** The semantic role of the toporef in context, as defined in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Role       | Definition \n",
    "---|---\n",
    "active | An active toporef is a place part of the current topos or spatial frame, though not strictly speaking a separate setting.\n",
    "passive | A passive toporef is one which names a place which is not part of the current topos, but which does constitute a setting in the text.\n",
    "metaphor | Coding a toporef as metaphorical indicates that it is being used figuratively: the place name is not a setting within the text, but is being used for other rhetorical purposes. \n",
    "alt | If a place has been referred to by multiple names, use the ‘alt’ value for the role attribute.\n",
    "act | An ‘act’ toporef indicates an act of initial naming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```relation:```** The manner in which the toporefs relates to its containing topoi, as per the 'connection' relations defined above, though not all values make sense for use with toporefs. Possible values therefore include ```direct```, ```indirect```, ```projection``` and ```jump```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```source:```** *Optional: for use with alt and act toporef roles*. In order to associate one toporef with another when they either named or referred to by other names, the source attribute is used to identify the cardinal (or source) toporef. For example:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1: Active\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "This Hermit good lives in <toporef role=\"active\" relation=\"direct\">that wood</toporef> \n",

    "So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge.

    "1. Use a programmer's text editor to create your XML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "   A programmer's text editor such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) have features that help make writing XML easier, such as tag completion and syntax highlighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keep the Chronotopic Cartographies schema handy as you edit\n",
    "\n",
    "   If your text editor supports split windows, keep the document you are editing in one tab and the schema in the other. This will allow you to simply copy and paste the necessary tags as you work.\n",
    "\n",
    "   (For convenience, the complete tag list can be found above).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Keep track of the names of your topoi\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you're working on a novel, you may end up with a very large number of topoi. It's very easy to lose track of these, so it's worth listing their names as you work (possibly in the same document as the schema)."

    "The same problem can occur for toporefs – ensure that you have closed the tag. Work back up from where the problem is identified by Validator until you find an open tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mismatched Topoi\n",
    "\n",
    "A second issue is inconsistent naming of Topoi. If a place is capitalised in one mention but not in another the computer will read these as different places. E.g. hovel; Hovel. Similarly, if you have left a space ahead of a toporef name or after it within the XML frame; or used capitals for one name but not for another of the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you have empty nodes with no attributes, this is generally caused by ‘source’ and ‘target’ attributes in your connection tags being mismatched with the node names – make sure you are consistent.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can use the ‘data laboratory’ to make final amendments to labels on the graph in Gephi. Gephi automatically opens in ‘overview’. On the top left, you can switch to view the ‘data laboratory’ instead. The data laboratory provides a list of all names on the graph (topoi and toporefs).

    "\n",
    "Starting with either the ‘complete’ or ‘topoi’ graph file, from the ‘Filters’ pane (usually on the right hand side of the main window), drag the ‘relation’ item down to the ‘Queries’ pane. Once you have done this, click on it, and edit the ‘pattern’ text box to read ‘direct’.\n",

    "# 3. Addendum: An Explanation of the Map Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Each individual marked-up XML text when processed using a custom Python script generates not one map but a map series.  These present different kinds of spatial relations in the text. We call these graphs “maps” because, although they are topological forms, this is their primary function in relation to a literary text.  They allow for the relative mapping of the internal contents of a text (as opposed to the absolute mapping of the literary world onto the real). We are calling this “literary topology”.  The map types are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Map\n",
    "This is a full map of a text showing the topoi (nodes), their associated toporefs (place-names referenced in a node), and the connections between them (lines/arrows). This graph shows the full spatial extent of a text.  The map is helpful for shorter texts (e.g. poems) but becomes overloaded in relation to highly complex texts (e.g. nineteenth-century novels). In such cases it is necessary to show details alongside the master map or to code up and  generate maps for certain sections of the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Topoi Map\n",
    "This privileges the topoi (nodes) and the connections between them without displaying their associated toporefs (within a node). Whilst this loses the detail of the complete map, the spatial structure is considerably clearer, and it is therefore useful for visualising longer texts. The map shows place names for nodes but not chronotopic types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topoi and Chronotopic Archetypes\n",
    "This shows the relationship between the topoi as place-names and their underlying chronotopic types (e.g. “Geneva”/ “Prison”).   Since there is no spatial relationship between the topoi and their underlying chronotopes the connections between them are not coloured.  For many texts this graph therefore appears as disconnected clusters. However, chronotopes become interconnected where the same place name (e.g. “Geneva”) shifts from being identified chronotopically as “Prison” (chronotopic identity 1) to “Idyll” (chronotopic identity 2). Now the clusters become interlinked.  As well as showing the relationship between the chronotopes and the topoi, this therefore also shows how chronotopes can shift dynamically over the course of a text.  Some texts do this far more than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Chronotope Map\n",
    "This is the simplest map to understand.  It represents each chronotope as a single node. The size of the nodes reflects the percentage of the text dedicated to each chronotope. This is useful for showing the balance of chronotopic spatio-temporal forms across a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toporefs and Chronotopic Archetypes\n",
    "This map shows which toporefs (detailed place names) are associated with a chronotopic archetype (e.g. “road”) showing how a text correlates different places with each spatio-temporal form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syuzhet Map \n",
    "This shows the topoi and their connections as they appear sequentially across the text. This is a spatialised visualisation of the “syuzhet” as defined in Proppian narratology: the plot or  narrative as it is told (i.e. may be disordered, fragmented involve flashback etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Fabula Map\n",
    "Partnering with the Syuzhet Map above, the Fabula Map shows the topoi and connections in the order of the story: that is, the order in which events occurred (not necessarily the order as narrated).  This is difficult to achieve for a complex text, so at present fabula maps only exist for shorter poems with the Fabula constructed by re-ordering the Syuzhet rather than generated directly. "

    "# Using the Chronotopic Cartographies Toolset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chronotopic Cartographies spatial schema identifies three principal units of the literary text: *topoi*, or spatial frames; *toporefs*, or linguistic spatial references within a spatial frame; and *connections*, which are described or implied spatial connections between topoi.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives comprehensive instructions, with worked examples and excercises, on how to use these components to mark up a text using the schema. By the end of it, you will have marked up a text extract using the schema and produced a visualisation of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequistes\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst this notebook talks you through the full process for marking up a text, some experience of using XML is recommended. A good primer can be found here: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-newxml/index.html. Wikipedia's [entry on markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) is also useful for an overview of what a markup language is and why they're useful for humanities scholarship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst we won't be diving deep into Python, we will be using some simple commands to check our work and to make simple visualisations as we go along. If you don't have any familiarity with programming with Python, the sections on *functions*, *variables* and *types* on [this web page](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter1/) are worth a scan, but it's not essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, some familiarity with Mikhail Bakhtin's essay 'Forms of Time and the Chronotope in the Novel' in _The Dialogic Imagination_ and with [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) would be useful.\n",

    "## Topoi\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markup\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<topos type=\"xx\" framename=\"yy\"> </topos>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A topos defines a spatial frame in both terms of narrative and chronotope: i.e., it indicates a place in which a section of narrative is set, and characterises that setting in terms of Bakhtin's terminology. In order to keep track of settings, they are given a unique name (the 'framename' attribute), ideally derived from the text. However, as long as the name is consistent across settings (ie., a setting within the text is always referred to in the ‘frame’ attribute with the same name) it is in effect arbitrary. If a chapter break occurs with the successor set in the same frame, a new identically-named frame will need to be opened, but no connection tag is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Coleridge's *Rime of the Ancyent Marinere*, the text moves between multiple identifiable settings: the Wedding at which the Mariner encounters the Guest; the Harbour from which the Mariner's ship departs; the Southern Ocean where the Mariner shoots the Albatross. Identifying these spaces and naming them allows us to track how much of the narrative is dedicated to each, their relative significance, and how they are connected with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each topos is given a 'type' attribute, derived from Bakhtin's chronotope essay. Use the table of chronotopes below and choose which you think is most appropriate. Note that there is a  degree of subjectivity in both identifying the bounds of the topoi and their chronotopes! In the example below, the Wedding is coded ‘encounter’, as this best describes the nature of how the Guest meets the Mariner, whilst the Harbour is coded a ‘threshold’ as it marks the point at which the Mariner leaves the safety of his home port and begins his journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**```framename:```** The name of the topos. This is arbitrary and at the coder's discretion, with two caveats: each topos in the text must have a unique framename; and if the text returns to a topos more than once, the corresponding text blocks must have the same framename attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```type:```** The chronotopic archetype, as defined in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chronotope       | Definition \n",
    "---|---\n",
    "encounter | Can occur anywhere (but often on the road), unexpected diversion, sudden shift, any meeting\n",
    "road | Paths, travel, journey, options, coming and going, wandering\n",
    "castle | Confined, Imprisonment, static, discomfort, dark, visible traces of the past\n",
    "idyll | Familiarity, comfort, happiness, pleasure, peace, respite, self-contained, unified, stable, homely, known\n",
    "wilderness | the wild, openness, freedom, untouched, the earth, the natural world, unity\n",
    "anti-idyll | vast, abstract, egotistically sealed-off interior worlds, mechanical, the idyll destroyed, invaded/made alien\n",
    "threshold | The hall, the corridor, the staircase, the street, docks, stations, liminal, emotionally charged, intense, sublime, excess, contrasts \n",
    "parlour | Interior, room, defined, hosting guests, where the public and private merge, where dialogues happen, site of political and commercial intrigue\n",
    "provincial town | Community, locality, rustic, petty-bourgeois, specific locales, quaint little houses and rooms of the town, sleepy streets\n",
    "public square | Dynamic, crowd, forum, metropolitan, the internal externalized (the private/intimate becomes public), theatrical (place of the clown, the rogue, the fool)\n",
    "distortion | Elsewhere, miraculous, bewitched, dreamstates, (occurring on the vertical axis - ie. depth and height)\n",
    "metanarrative | For sections of text removed from the narrative and without a definable sense of space, could be internal (e.g. commentary, where the author inserts themselves, morals, etc) or external (e.g. glosses, framing statements, authorial/editorial notes, etc) to the narrative.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Toporefs indicate the named or otherwise defined places that form a ‘frame’ in the text and their role within it: ie., whether they refer to places within a given topos; another topos outside of the current one; or are being used figuratively. They also indicate how names are connected to topoi frame.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**```role:```** The semantic role of the toporef in context, as defined in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Role       | Definition \n",
    "---|---\n",
    "active | An active toporef is a place part of the current topos or spatial frame, though not strictly speaking a separate setting.\n",
    "passive | A passive toporef is one which names a place which is not part of the current topos, but which does constitute a setting in the text.\n",
    "metaphor | Coding a toporef as metaphorical indicates that it is being used figuratively: the place name is not a setting within the text, but is being used for other rhetorical purposes. \n",
    "alt | If a place has been referred to by multiple names, use the ‘alt’ value for the role attribute.\n",
    "act | An ‘act’ toporef indicates an act of initial naming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```relation:```** The manner in which the toporefs relates to its containing topoi, as per the 'connection' relations defined above, though not all values make sense for use with toporefs. Possible values therefore include ```direct```, ```indirect```, ```projection``` and ```jump```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```source:```** *Optional: for use with alt and act toporef roles*. In order to associate one toporef with another when they either named or referred to by other names, the source attribute is used to identify the cardinal (or source) toporef. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "Jim thought back to <toporef role=\"alt\" relation=\"projection\" source=\"The Admiral Benbow Inn\">the tavern</toporef> with a wistful sigh.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, the ```source``` attribute connects the toporef 'the tavern' to another, 'The Admiral Benbow Inn', with the ```role``` 'alt' identifying it as an alternative name for that toporef.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1: Active\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "This Hermit good lives in <toporef role=\"active\" relation=\"direct\">that wood</toporef> \n",
    "Which slopes down to the sea\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1: Passive\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; a numbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle I lay and dreamed of home and the old <toporef role=\"passive\" relation=\"projection\">Admiral Benbow</toporef>. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metaphor\n",
    "\n",

    "# Spatial Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chronotopic Cartographies spatial schema identifies three principal units of the literary text: *topoi*, or spatial frames; *toporefs*, or linguistic spatial references within a spatial frame; and *connections*, which are described or implied spatial connections between topoi.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives comprehensive instructions, with worked examples, as to how to use these components to mark up a text to create a relative spatial graph of your reading of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Topoi\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A topos defines a spatial frame in both terms of narrative and chronotope: i.e., it indicates a place in which a section of narrative is set, and characterises that setting in terms of Bakhtin's terminology. In order to keep track of settings, they are given a unique name (the 'framename' attribute), ideally derived from the text. However, as long as the name is consistent across settings (i.e., a setting within the text is always referred to in the ‘frame’ attribute with the same name) it is in effect arbitrary.  If a chapter break occurs with the successor set in the same frame a new identically-named frame will need to be opened, but no connection tag is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Coleridge's *Rime of the Ancyent Marinere*, the text moves between multiple identifiable settings: the Wedding at which the Mariner encounters the Guest; the Harbour from which the Mariner's ship departs; the Southern Ocean where the Mariner shoots the Albatross. Identifying these spaces and naming them allows us to track how much of the narrative is dedicated to each, their relative significance, and how they are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ‘type’ attribute, use the table of chronotopes in the schema document and choose which you think is most appropriate. These are taken from Bakhtin’s essay ‘Forms of Time and the Chronotope in the Novel’. In the example below, the Wedding is coded ‘encounter’, as this best describes the nature of how the Guest meets the Mariner, whilst the Harbour is coded a ‘threshold’ as it marks the point at which the Mariner leaves the safety of his home port and begins his journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markup\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**```framename:```** The name of the topos. This is arbitrary and at the coder's discretion, with two caveats: each topos in the text must have a unique framename; and if the text returns to a topos more than once, the corresponding text blocks must have the same framename attribute.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Chronotope       | Definition \n",
    "---|---\n",

    "anti-idyll | vast, abstract, egotistically sealed-off interior worlds, mechanical, the idyll destroyed, invaded/made alien\n",
    "threshold | The hall, the corridor, the staircase, the street, docks, stations, liminal, emotionally charged, intense, sublime, excess, contrasts \n",
    "parlour | Interior, room, defined, hosting guests, where the public and private merge, where dialogues happen, site of political and commercial intrigue\n",
    "provincial town | Community, locality, rustic, petty-bourgeois, specific locales, quaint little houses and rooms of the town, sleepy streets\n",
    "public square | Dynamic, crowd, forum, metropolitan, the internal externalized (the private/intimate becomes public), theatrical (place of the clown, the rogue, the fool)\n",
    "distorition | Elsewhere, miraculous, bewitched, dreamstates, (occurring on the vertical axis - ie. depth and height)\n",
    "metanarrative | For sections of text removed from the narrative and without a definable sense of space, could be internal (e.g. commentary, where the author inserts themselves, morals, etc) or external (e.g. glosses, framing statements, authorial/editorial notes, etc) to the narrative.\n",

    "passive | A passive toporef is one which names a place which is not part of the current topos, but which does constitute a setting in the text.\n",
    "metaphor | Coding a toporef as metaphorical indicates that it is being used figuratively: the place name is not a setting within the text, but is being used for other rhetorical purposes. \n",
    "alt | If a place has been referred to by multiple names, use the ‘alt’ value for the role attribute.\n",

    "**```relation:```** The manner in which the toporefs relates to its containing topoi, as per the 'connection' relations defined above, though not all values make sense for use with toporefs. Possible values therefore include ```direct```, ```indirect```, ```projection``` and ```jump```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```source:```** *Optional: for use with alt and act toporef roles*. In order to associate one toporef with another when they either named or referred to by other names, the source attribute is used to identify the cardinal (or source) toporef. For example:\n",

    "So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; a numbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle I lay and dreamed of home and the old <toporef role=\"passive\" relation=\"projection\">Admiral Benbow</toporef>. \n",
